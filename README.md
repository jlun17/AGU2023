# The Practical Application of Atmospheric Tomography with 3D Radiative Transfer (AT3D) Using the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR): Supplemental Information

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aboard the NASA Terra satellite has been collecting multi-angle imagery for 24 years now. In the Level 1B Ellipsoid MISR data product, radiances are interpolated onto the Space Oblique Mercader projection and images from all nine view angles are co-registered on the Ellipsoid. One can then animate through all nine MISR view angles to see the parallax from anything that doesn't lie on the ellipsoid (i.e. clouds).

## MISR Movies
Here, we animate through images from all nine MISR view angles co-registered at 3km in altitude. Cloud tops are under 3km in altitude, so the greatest parallax can be seen at cloud base.

On the left are observations from MISR and on the right are forward simulations of multi-angle radiance at corresponding view angles.
